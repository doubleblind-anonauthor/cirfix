# To run CirFix locally:
        1. Make sure you have access to the Synopsys VCS simulator. An easy way to do so is to type "vcs" in the command line and ensure that the command exists
                1.1. If you do not have a Synopsys VCS license, you may use a different Verilog simulator. Note, however, that you'd need to update the scripts to match the API of the simulator (by default, we have designed CirFix to work with the API of VCS).
        2. Clone CirFix from GitHub
        3. Install PyVerilog version 1.2.1 -> pip3 install â€”user pyverilog==1.2.1
        4. Replace certain PyVerilog files to work with CirFix (see readme.txt in ../pyverilog_changes)
        5. Install iVerilog -> sudo yum install iverilog (for redHat, command may vary for different operating systems)
        6. Edit repair.conf to provide the parameters for CirFix, including the the source file, TB, etc.
        7. Run python3 repair.py
                7.1. Optional: If you want CirFix to keep a log, use the parameter log=true when running repair.py

# To reproduce the repairs generated by CirFix for a given bug:
        1. Look at the experiments_results.xlsx file to get the minimized patch list for the bug
        2. Run python3 repair.py code_from_patchlist=true
        3. When prompted, paste the minimized patchlist into the terminal

# To reproduce an entire trial of CirFix for a repair:
        1. Look at the experiments_results.xlsx file to get the seed that produced the repair
        2. Edit repair.conf to force that seed for the CirFix run
